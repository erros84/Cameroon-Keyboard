Hi Matthew,

The ə Ə and ɔ Ɔ are used most of the special characters, in that order.  We
do not have q or x in the alphabet.  We don't need ø ʉ ẅ α ɓ ɗ ◌.  We do
use ə ɔ ŋ Ŋ ʼ ɛ Ɛ ɨ Ɨ (in that order).  One other thing is that L is very
rarely used.  I don't know if we want to make L an special character of
r (it is an allophone), and put ŋ in the l spot.  But that might just
confuse me.

Based on QWERTY

Thanks

Lance
